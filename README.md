Fitted a Logistic regression model to classify whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic subject to certain independent variables. Performed all the required data-preprocessing like missing value removal, outlier removal and data visualization. Split the dataset into a train and test set and fit a logistic regression model on the test set. After that compared the predicted outcomes with that of the actual outcomes in the test set to find out various metrics like accuracy,recall,precision,F1 score, AUC and ROC to make necessary interpretations.
